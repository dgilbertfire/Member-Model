I'd love to see the club sponsor or subsidize some away trips for season ticket members and other supporters, whether or not our regular seats are in the supporters section. I've had the sense the 2020 season that the club is keen to try and limit the definition of """"supporters"""" to only those with season tickets in particular standing sections. One of the best ways to turn customers into supporters is to get them to away trips. Even though it was a Section 8-organized trip, the Chicago Fire promoted the 2007 away game trip to Columbus in the stadium. It was a critical game (the Wanchope goal!) and so many people went, and so many of them became supporters for life (myself included and many of my supporter friends).   Two benefits I love that were not mentioned above are 1) the season ticket members-only bar—that really cuts down on time in drinks lines—and 2) the Apple MLS Season Pass—that's great for watching away games and keeping up with what's going on around the league. I wish there were a regular home announcing team audio available for all of these games.  The 2023 Member gift: a scarf is a great thing in theory, but I don't love these. Something exclusive and celebrating the 2023 season would have been great. Something advertising me as a """"Season Ticket Member"""" is not that.

I’m sure it’s great that Mr. Baldwin can tout his previous experience selling suites and boxes to the wealthy in his prior roles, but when you look around the league, the teams bringing in consistent and excited crowds (Atlanta, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Austin) do so because they have passionate fans for the club. And consistent crowds ensure consistent revenue; not gouging fans to see Messi and making that game more about the other player than your own (very struggling team). It’s also clear the plan is to keep raising prices, which comes as doubly difficult to swallow, segueing into the next issue.  More troublesome have been the Fire’s decisions since failing to qualify for the playoffs yet again. I believe the owner truly does have the best interests of the Fire and has invested an immense amount of his own money, but it is baffling, truly baffling that a man who built his fortune on savvy business decisions can justify keeping Georg Heitz in role when in Heitz’s 3.5 years so far he has unilaterally failed at his job. The Fire have had one of the highest wage bills in the league and yet, having nothing to show for it. We have not had a successful DP since before Heitz’ tenure and his TAM and GAM spending decisions have resulted in us paying guaranteed huge salaries to players who are ineffective, while underpaying our performing youth. Then, as quintessential as Frank Klopas is to this team and as much as he should be a part of the team, a long term head coach he is not. Failing to capitalize on having nearly six months to find a strong coach is yet another misstep. As a fan, it is understandable that there are ups and downs and change can take time, but making the same decision over and over and expecting something different merely means you’re complacent with what you have.  I would like to see the Fire focus on understanding why it cannot tap the huge soccer fan base in Chicago, and hand-in-hand with that, improve the actual quality of the team. When you do those things, that is how you build a business. When you focus purely on profit, that is how you lose your fans.  All of that to say, we will keep our season tickets this year, but are seriously considering dropping them in future years. We want to support our local club and love going to games, but can’t continue to get behind a sinking ship, both from the business side of the house and the on-the-field product.","{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.25}",0.066,0.845,0.089,0.25,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.211, 'compound': 0.4939}",0.0,0.789,0.211,0.4939,"{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9906}",0.083,0.761,0.157,0.9906

I like watching soccer, and like supporting my local team.",8.0,No,"I wanted to clarify a few points. Adrian is lovely, and polite, can tell he's just new to the role. Eric was the gold standard for me, he'd call just to see how things were and check it and it was always appreciated. As a rep, he was thoughtful engaged, and I've enjoyed my brief interactions with Adrian so far, but I went the majority of the year without a rep, and it's just felt like year on year, that connection with them has just diminished. As if interactions are more transactional than supportive.  My number 1 complain this year, is how the club responds to the games scheduled in Bridgeview. I'm a long term season ticket holder, and a public transport user who doesn't drive and the club does nothing to help me attend games when they're moved. In previous years there was the pub to pitch program, or the Pace operated Midway to Bridgeview shuttle bus, and they were fantastic, but neither of them run now, and every time they move a game, there's always little to no clarity on whether they'll bring back pub to pitch, and most reps (not Adrian) didn't have a clue. Nor did they have any guidance on how to actually get to the stadium. Nor any follow up, or any support. It was just an attitude, of, oh well nothing I can do, and not supportive at all. It's always deeply frustrating, and massively puts me off any rescheduled game.   The second complaint, is that the restricting of fantastic supporters perks like the bike valet, which is a wonderful program to those who are only in the supporters section is ridiculous. To pay more money, to have a restricted service is deeply disappointing. I broadly use divvy, when cycling in the summer, so I get by cycling to games, but just sad not being able to share in it if I wanted to cycle on my own by to the stadium.   But beyond that, game day experience has improved immensely, beyond some retail staff, and Monterey aggression, most if not all Fire staff have always been kind and it's always been appreciated.","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.6808}",0.047,0.809,0.144,0.6808,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.25}",0.109,0.761,0.13,0.25,"{'neg': 0.126, 'neu': 0.811, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.34}",0.126,0.811,0.063,-0.34,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.654, 'pos': 0.346, 'compound': 0.9393}",0.0,0.654,0.346,0.9393,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.73, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.9884}",0.092,0.73,0.178,0.9884
